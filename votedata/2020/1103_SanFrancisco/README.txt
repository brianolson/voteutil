San Francisco has made some good noises about running open source elections, but I wish they had it _now_ because while I apparently final data, I'm left guessing how to tweak my code to match their results.


We need Open Source elections. Hours of coding later I still can't reproduce San Francisco's results for the 2020 elections.

The San Francisco 2020-11 election doesn't seem to be reproducible. They publish their full data, but after two days of tweaking my code against their data I can't get their results.
